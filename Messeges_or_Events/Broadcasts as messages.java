To send and receive broadcasts in a Spring Boot application, you can use RabbitMQ as the message broker to facilitate pub/sub (publish-subscribe) messaging. Broadcasting allows one or more publishers to send messages to multiple subscribers who are interested in receiving those messages. Here's an example of how to achieve this in Spring Boot:

**1. Configure RabbitMQ:**

First, you'll need to configure RabbitMQ similar to what was done in your previous example. Ensure you have RabbitMQ running and configure its connection properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest
```

**2. Create a Configuration Class:**

You'll need a configuration class to set up the necessary RabbitMQ components for broadcasting.

```java
import org.springframework.amqp.core.FanoutExchange;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class RabbitMQBroadcastConfig {

    @Bean
    public FanoutExchange fanoutExchange() {
        return new FanoutExchange("broadcast.exchange");
    }
}
```

In this example, we're defining a `FanoutExchange` named "broadcast.exchange." A fanout exchange broadcasts messages to all the queues it knows.

**3. Create Message Producers:**

Now, you can create message producers that publish messages to the exchange. You can have multiple producers sending messages to the same exchange, and all subscribers to the exchange will receive those messages.

```java
import org.springframework.amqp.core.FanoutExchange;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class BroadcastProducer {

    private final RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;
    private final FanoutExchange fanoutExchange;

    @Autowired
    public BroadcastProducer(RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate, FanoutExchange fanoutExchange) {
        this.rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
        this.fanoutExchange = fanoutExchange;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(fanoutExchange.getName(), "", message);
    }
}
```

In this producer, we inject the `RabbitTemplate` and the `FanoutExchange` configured earlier. The `sendMessage` method sends a message to the fanout exchange, which will broadcast it to all its queues.

**4. Create Message Consumers:**

Create message consumers that will subscribe to the broadcasted messages.

```java
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class BroadcastConsumer {

    @RabbitListener(queues = "queue1")
    public void receiveMessageFromQueue1(String message) {
        // Process the message received from queue1
    }

    @RabbitListener(queues = "queue2")
    public void receiveMessageFromQueue2(String message) {
        // Process the message received from queue2
    }
}
```

Here, we have two consumers listening to two different queues, "queue1" and "queue2." These queues are not explicitly defined; RabbitMQ will create them automatically.

**5. Broadcasting Messages:**

You can send messages to the broadcast exchange using the `BroadcastProducer` you created earlier.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class BroadcastController {

    private final BroadcastProducer broadcastProducer;

    @Autowired
    public BroadcastController(BroadcastProducer broadcastProducer) {
        this.broadcastProducer = broadcastProducer;
    }

    @PostMapping("/broadcast")
    public ResponseEntity<String> broadcastMessage(@RequestBody String message) {
        broadcastProducer.sendMessage(message);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Message broadcasted...");
    }
}
```

In this REST controller, the `broadcastMessage` endpoint sends a message to the fanout exchange, which will broadcast it to all the queues subscribed to the exchange.

That's it! With this setup, you can send broadcast messages to multiple queues, and multiple consumers can subscribe to those queues to receive the broadcasted messages.
