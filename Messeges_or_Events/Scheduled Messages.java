To send and receive scheduled messages in a Spring Boot application, you can use Spring's built-in scheduling support along with a message broker like RabbitMQ. Here's how you can achieve this:

**1. Configure Spring Boot for Scheduling:**

In your Spring Boot application, you need to configure scheduling using Spring's `@Scheduled` annotation. This annotation allows you to define methods that will run periodically.

```java
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@EnableScheduling
@Component
public class ScheduledMessageSender {

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000) // Send a message every 5 seconds
    public void sendScheduledMessage() {
        // Code to send a scheduled message
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `@Scheduled` annotation is used to specify that the `sendScheduledMessage` method should run every 5 seconds.

**2. Configure RabbitMQ:**

You can configure RabbitMQ as described in the previous answer by defining queues, exchanges, bindings, and a `RabbitTemplate`. Ensure that you have RabbitMQ running and the necessary configuration set up.

**3. Sending Scheduled Messages:**

To send scheduled messages to RabbitMQ, you can use the `RabbitTemplate` from the RabbitMQ configuration.

```java
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ScheduledMessageSender {

    private final RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public ScheduledMessageSender(RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate) {
        this.rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000) // Send a message every 5 seconds
    public void sendScheduledMessage() {
        String message = "Scheduled message to be sent.";
        rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("exchangeName", "routingKey", message);
    }
}
```

In the `sendScheduledMessage` method, you can use the `rabbitTemplate` to send a message to RabbitMQ. You need to specify the exchange and routing key as per your RabbitMQ configuration.

**4. Receiving Scheduled Messages:**

To receive scheduled messages from RabbitMQ, you can create a consumer as shown in the previous answer. Ensure that you have a `@RabbitListener` annotated method listening to the queue where the scheduled messages are being sent.

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class ScheduledMessageReceiver {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ScheduledMessageReceiver.class);

    @RabbitListener(queues = "yourQueueName")
    public void receiveScheduledMessage(String message) {
        LOGGER.info("Received scheduled message: " + message);
        // Handle the received message
    }
}
```

In this code, the `receiveScheduledMessage` method listens to the specified queue and logs the received message. You can process the message as needed within this method.

With this setup, your Spring Boot application will periodically send messages to RabbitMQ using the scheduler, and the `ScheduledMessageReceiver` component will consume and process these scheduled messages as they arrive in the queue.
