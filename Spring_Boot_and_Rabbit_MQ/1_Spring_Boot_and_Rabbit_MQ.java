To implement messaging between your Spring Boot microservices using RabbitMQ, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Set up RabbitMQ:
   - First, make sure you have RabbitMQ installed and running.
   - You can download and install RabbitMQ from the official website: https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html.
   - You should also have RabbitMQ management plugin enabled for easier monitoring and management. You can enable it by running the following command: `rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management`.

2. Add Dependencies:
   - In your Spring Boot projects, add the `spring-boot-starter-amqp` dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-amqp</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

3. Configure RabbitMQ in your Spring Boot applications:
   - In your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file for each microservice, configure RabbitMQ connection properties. Replace `your-rabbitmq-host`, `your-rabbitmq-username`, and `your-rabbitmq-password` with your RabbitMQ server information.

   For the Catalog Service (book catalogue):
   ```yaml
   spring.rabbitmq.host=your-rabbitmq-host
   spring.rabbitmq.username=your-rabbitmq-username
   spring.rabbitmq.password=your-rabbitmq-password
   ```

   For the Review Service:
   ```yaml
   spring.rabbitmq.host=your-rabbitmq-host
   spring.rabbitmq.username=your-rabbitmq-username
   spring.rabbitmq.password=your-rabbitmq-password
   ```

4. Create a RabbitMQ configuration for each microservice:
   - Create a configuration class in each microservice to configure the RabbitMQ connection and set up the necessary beans.

   For the Catalog Service:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class RabbitMQConfig {

       @Bean
       public Queue bookReviewQueue() {
           return new Queue("bookReviewQueue");
       }
   }
   ```

   For the Review Service:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class RabbitMQConfig {

       @Bean
       public Queue reviewQueue() {
           return new Queue("reviewQueue");
       }
   }
   ```

5. Implement Publisher and Consumer in Microservices:

   - In the Catalog Service, create a publisher to send a message when a new review is added.

   ```java
   @Autowired
   private AmqpTemplate amqpTemplate;

   public void sendNewReviewMessage(String bookId) {
       amqpTemplate.convertAndSend("bookReviewQueue", bookId);
   }
   ```

   - In the Review Service, create a consumer to listen for new review messages and process them.

   ```java
   @RabbitListener(queues = "bookReviewQueue")
   public void receiveNewReviewMessage(String bookId) {
       // Handle the new review message and update the review count in the catalog service.
   }
   ```

6. Trigger Messaging Events:
   - When a new review is added in the Review Service, call the `sendNewReviewMessage` method to send a message to the Catalog Service.

7. Handle the Message:
   - In the Catalog Service, the `receiveNewReviewMessage` method will be called when a new review message is received. Handle the message and update the book's review count.

That's the basic outline of how to use RabbitMQ to send messages between your Spring Boot microservices. Make sure to customize and adapt the code to your specific use case and business logic. Also, consider error handling and message validation for production use.
