To use RabbitMQ in Spring Boot, you will need to:

1. Add the RabbitMQ dependency to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Create a RabbitMQ configuration file:

```yaml
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
    port: 5672
    username: guest
    password: guest
```

3. Create a RabbitMQ producer bean:

```java
@Bean
public RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new RabbitTemplate(connectionFactory);
}
```

4. Create a RabbitMQ consumer bean:

```java
@Bean
public SimpleMessageListenerContainer simpleMessageListenerContainer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    SimpleMessageListenerContainer container = new SimpleMessageListenerContainer(connectionFactory);
    container.setQueueNames("my-queue");
    container.setMessageListener(new MessageListenerAdapter(new MyConsumer()));
    return container;
}
```

5. Create a MyConsumer class that implements the MessageListener interface:

```java
public class MyConsumer implements MessageListener {

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        // Process the message
    }
}
```

6. Start the Spring Boot application.

Once the Spring Boot application is started, the RabbitMQ consumer will start listening for messages on the `my-queue` queue. When a message is received, the consumer will call the `onMessage()` method to process the message.

To send a message to the `my-queue` queue, you can use the RabbitMQ producer bean:

```java
rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("my-queue", "Hello, world!");
```

This will send the message "Hello, world!" to the `my-queue` queue.

To use RabbitMQ in your microservices application, you can follow the same steps above. However, you will need to make sure that the RabbitMQ broker is accessible to all of your microservices.

In your case, you would need to send a message to the book catalogue microservice whenever a new review is added for a book. You can do this by creating a RabbitMQ producer in the review service microservice and sending a message to the book catalogue microservice's queue.

The book catalogue microservice would then need to have a RabbitMQ consumer that listens for messages on its queue. When a message is received, the consumer can increment the review count for the book in the book catalogue.

Here is an example of a RabbitMQ producer in the review service microservice that sends a message to the book catalogue microservice's queue:

```java
@Bean
public RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new RabbitTemplate(connectionFactory);
}

@EventListener(ReviewAddedEvent.class)
public void handleReviewAddedEvent(ReviewAddedEvent event) {
    // Create a message to send to the book catalogue microservice
    Message message = new Message(event.getBookId().toString().getBytes());

    // Send the message to the book catalogue microservice's queue
    rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("book-catalogue-queue", message);
}
```

This producer will send a message to the `book-catalogue-queue` queue whenever a new review is added for a book.

The book catalogue microservice would then need to have a RabbitMQ consumer that listens for messages on the `book-catalogue-queue` queue:

```java
@Bean
public SimpleMessageListenerContainer simpleMessageListenerContainer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    SimpleMessageListenerContainer container = new SimpleMessageListenerContainer(connectionFactory);
    container.setQueueNames("book-catalogue-queue");
    container.setMessageListener(new MessageListenerAdapter(new MyConsumer()));
    return container;
}

public class MyConsumer implements MessageListener {

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        // Increment the review count for the book in the book catalogue
        String bookId = new String(message.getBody());
        Book book = bookCatalogueRepository.findById(bookId).get();
        book.setReviewCount(book.getReviewCount() + 1);
        bookCatalogueRepository.save(book);
    }
}
```

This consumer will increment the review count for the book in the book catalogue whenever a message is received on the `book-catalogue-queue` queue.

By following these steps, you can use RabbitMQ to send messages between your microservices and implement complex messaging patterns.
