The error message "docker: Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:15672 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:15672: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions" typically means that the port you're trying to bind to is already in use or is not allowed to be accessed.

There are several possible solutions to this issue:

1. **Check if the port is already in use**: Use a command like `netstat -ano | findstr :<yourPortNumber>` on Windows or `lsof -i:<yourPortNumber>` on Linux to check if the port is already in use. If it is, you'll need to kill the process using that port or use a different port.

2. **Restart Docker**: Sometimes, simply restarting Docker can resolve the issue. You can do this from the Docker desktop application or by using the command `systemctl restart docker` on Linux.

3. **Stop and start the Windows Network Address Translation (WinNAT) service**: On Windows, the WinNAT service can sometimes cause issues with Docker. You can stop and start this service with the commands `net stop winnat` and `net start winnat` [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65272764/ports-are-not-available-listen-tcp-0-0-0-0-50070-bind-an-attempt-was-made-to).

4. **Check your Docker command**: Make sure you're running the Docker command correctly. For RabbitMQ, the command should look something like this: `docker run -d -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 --name some-rabbit rabbitmq:3-management`. This command tells Docker to run RabbitMQ in a new container and bind the ports 15672 and 5672 on the host to the corresponding ports in the container [Source 9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51885880/port-forwarding-failing-for-rabbitmq-in-docker).

5. **Run your terminal as an administrator**: If you're on Windows, try running your terminal as an administrator. This can sometimes resolve access permission issues.

Please remember to replace `<yourPortNumber>` with the port you are trying to bind to (in your case, 15672).
