To implement the Book Catalogue Service as a producer that uses RabbitMQ for message publishing, you'll need to make several modifications to your existing code. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

**1. Modify `Book` Model (Book.java):** Add an additional field to represent the book's unique identifier. This will allow you to associate book-related messages with specific books when sending messages to RabbitMQ.

```java
// Book.java
@Data
@Entity
@Slf4j
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Table(name = "books")
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "title")
    private String title;

    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "author")
    private String author;

    @Column(name = "price")
    @NotNull
    @NotBlank
    private Double price;

    @Column(name = "stock")
    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    @Min(0)
    private Integer stock;

    // Add an additional field to store the unique identifier for the book
    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "book_identifier", unique = true)
    private String bookIdentifier;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and other fields remain the same
}
```

**2. Modify `BookRepository` (BookRepository.java):** There's no need to make changes to the repository interface.

**3. Modify `CatalogService` (CatalogService.java):** Modify the `createBook` method to publish a message to RabbitMQ after saving the book. Ensure you have a RabbitMQ connection configured in your application properties.

```java
// CatalogService.java
@Service
@Slf4j
public class CatalogService {

    @Autowired
    private BookRepository bookRepository;

    @Autowired
    private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate; // Autowire RabbitTemplate

    @Value("${rabbitmq.exchange.name}") // Add exchange name to application properties
    private String exchangeName;

    @Value("${rabbitmq.routing.book.key}") // Add routing key for books to application properties
    private String routingBookKey;

    public Book createBook(Book book) {
        Book createdBook = bookRepository.save(book);

        // Publish a message to RabbitMQ after saving the book
        rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchangeName, routingBookKey, createdBook);

        return createdBook;
    }

    // Other methods remain the same
}
```

**4. Configure RabbitMQ in `application.properties`:** Add RabbitMQ configuration properties to your `application.properties` file.

```properties
# RabbitMQ Configuration
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest

# Exchange and Routing Key Configuration
rabbitmq.exchange.name=your_exchange_name
rabbitmq.routing.book.key=book.created
```

Ensure that you replace `your_exchange_name` with the appropriate exchange name for your RabbitMQ setup.

**5. Use Feign Client for Communication:** Your Book Catalogue Service can continue using the Feign Client to communicate with the Review Service as shown in your code.

With these modifications, your Book Catalogue Service will publish a message to RabbitMQ whenever a new book is created. The message contains the book details, including the book's unique identifier. Other services, such as the Review Service, can subscribe to this message and perform actions based on the book information.

Make sure you have RabbitMQ running and correctly configured with the exchange and queue(s) for message consumption in your microservices ecosystem.
