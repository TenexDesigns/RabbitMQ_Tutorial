The message published by the Review Service to RabbitMQ is often referred to as an "event." In the context of microservices and messaging systems, events are messages that represent something significant that has occurred within the system. These events are typically used to notify other parts of the system about specific state changes or actions.

In this case, when a review is created in the Review Service, it publishes an event to RabbitMQ. This event notifies other services or components within your microservices architecture that a review has been created. Other services can then consume and react to this event as needed. Events are a fundamental concept in event-driven architectures and are often used for decoupling components and enabling asynchronous communication between microservices.

So, in summary, the message published by the Review Service is indeed an "event" that signifies the creation of a review, and it allows other services to respond accordingly.
