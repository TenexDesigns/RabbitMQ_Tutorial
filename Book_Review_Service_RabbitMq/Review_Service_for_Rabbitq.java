To implement the Review Service as a producer that uses RabbitMQ for message publishing, you'll need to make several modifications to your existing code. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

**1. Modify `ReviewModel` (Review.java):** Add an additional field to represent the book's ID to which the review is related. This will allow you to associate a review with a specific book when sending messages to RabbitMQ.

```java
// Review.java
@Data
@Entity
@Slf4j
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Table(name = "reviews")
public class ReviewModel {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "book_id")
    private String bookId; // Added field to store the related book's ID

    @NotBlank
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "rating")
    private Integer rating;

    @Column(name = "review")
    @NotNull
    @NotBlank
    private String review;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and other fields remain the same
}
```

**2. Modify `ReviewRepository` (ReviewRepository.java):** There's no need to make changes to the repository interface.

**3. Modify `ReviewService` (ReviewService.java):** Modify the `createReview` method to publish a message to RabbitMQ after saving the review. Ensure you have a RabbitMQ connection configured in your application properties.

```java
// ReviewService.java
@Service
@Slf4j
public class ReviewService {

    @Autowired
    private ReviewRepository reviewRepository;

    @Autowired
    private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate; // Autowire RabbitTemplate

    @Value("${rabbitmq.exchange.name}") // Add exchange name to application properties
    private String exchangeName;

    @Value("${rabbitmq.routing.review.key}") // Add routing key for reviews to application properties
    private String routingReviewKey;

    public ReviewModel createReview(ReviewModel review) {
        ReviewModel createdReview = reviewRepository.save(review);

        // Publish a message to RabbitMQ after saving the review
        rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchangeName, routingReviewKey, createdReview);

        return createdReview;
    }

    // Other methods remain the same
}
```

**4. Configure RabbitMQ in `application.properties`:** Add RabbitMQ configuration properties to your `application.properties` file.

```properties
# RabbitMQ Configuration
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest

# Exchange and Routing Key Configuration
rabbitmq.exchange.name=your_exchange_name
rabbitmq.routing.review.key=review.created
```

Ensure that you replace `your_exchange_name` with the appropriate exchange name for your RabbitMQ setup.

**5. Use Feign Client for Communication:** Your Review Service can continue using the Feign Client to communicate with the Book Catalogue Service as shown in your code.

With these modifications, your Review Service will publish a message to RabbitMQ whenever a new review is created. The message contains the review details, including the associated book's ID. Other services, such as the Book Catalogue Service, can subscribe to this message and perform actions based on the review information.

Make sure you have RabbitMQ running and correctly configured with the exchange and queue(s) for message consumption in your microservices ecosystem.
