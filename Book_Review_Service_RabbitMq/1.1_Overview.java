In your two services (Review Service and Book Service) using RabbitMQ, here's how the key components like producer, consumer, exchange, routing, and queue come into play with code samples:

**Review Service (Producer):**

1. **Producer Code Sample:**

   The Review Service acts as the producer, which creates and publishes review messages to RabbitMQ.

   ```java
   // Producer Code Sample in ReviewService
   @Service
   public class ReviewService {
       // ...

       @Autowired
       private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate; // Autowire RabbitTemplate

       @Value("${rabbitmq.exchange.name}") // Exchange name from application.properties
       private String exchangeName;

       @Value("${rabbitmq.routing.review.key}") // Routing key from application.properties
       private String routingReviewKey;

       public ReviewModel createReview(ReviewModel review) {
           ReviewModel createdReview = reviewRepository.save(review);

           // Publish a message to RabbitMQ after saving the review
           rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(exchangeName, routingReviewKey, createdReview);

           return createdReview;
       }

       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Exchange and Routing Configuration:**

   The Review Service configures the RabbitMQ exchange and routing key in the `RabbitMQConfig` class.

   ```java
   // Exchange and Routing Configuration in ReviewService
   @Configuration
   public class RabbitMQConfig {
       // ...

       @Bean
       public Exchange fanoutExchange() {
           return new FanoutExchange("your_exchange_name"); // Replace with your exchange name
       }

       @Bean
       public Queue reviewQueue() {
           return new Queue("reviewQueue"); // Define the queue name
       }

       @Bean
       public Binding binding(Queue reviewQueue, Exchange fanoutExchange) {
           return BindingBuilder.bind(reviewQueue).to(fanoutExchange);
       }
   }
   ```

**Book Service (Consumer):**

1. **Consumer Code Sample:**

   The Book Service acts as the consumer, which listens for review messages from RabbitMQ and processes them.

   ```java
   // Consumer Code Sample in BookService
   @Service
   public class RabbitMQListener {

       @RabbitListener(queues = "reviewQueue") // Queue name
       public void processReview(ReviewModel review) {
           // Implement logic to handle the incoming review
           // e.g., update book information based on the review
           System.out.println("Received review: " + review);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Exchange and Queue Configuration:**

   The Book Service configures the RabbitMQ queue that it listens to in the `RabbitMQConfig` class.

   ```java
   // Exchange and Queue Configuration in BookService
   @Configuration
   public class RabbitMQConfig {

       @Bean
       public Queue reviewQueue() {
           return new Queue("reviewQueue"); // Define the queue name
       }

       // You may need to bind the queue to an exchange (e.g., FanoutExchange) as shown in ReviewService
   }
   ```

In summary:

- **Producer:** Review Service acts as the producer, creating and publishing review messages to RabbitMQ.

- **Consumer:** Book Service acts as the consumer, listening for review messages from RabbitMQ and processing them.

- **Exchange:** Both services configure a RabbitMQ exchange (FanoutExchange in this example) for message distribution. Review Service sends messages to this exchange.

- **Routing:** Review Service specifies a routing key when publishing messages. Book Service, as a consumer, listens to a specific queue for messages with the same routing key.

- **Queue:** Both services define a queue where messages are delivered. Review Service publishes messages to the queue, and Book Service listens to the same queue for incoming messages.

This setup allows the Review Service to send review messages, and the Book Service to receive and process those messages, ensuring communication between the services through RabbitMQ.
