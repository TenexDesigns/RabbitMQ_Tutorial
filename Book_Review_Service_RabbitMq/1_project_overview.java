Sure, I can suggest a simple microservices project involving a Book and Review service that uses RabbitMQ for communication between microservices. This project will demonstrate how RabbitMQ can be used for asynchronous communication in a microservices architecture.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, we will create two microservices:

1. **Book Service:** This microservice will manage information about books, including their titles, authors, and ISBNs. It will expose an API to retrieve book details.

2. **Review Service:** This microservice will handle book reviews. Users can submit reviews for books. It will expose an API to submit and retrieve book reviews.

**Communication between Microservices:**

Whenever a new review is submitted in the Review Service, it will notify the Book Service using RabbitMQ. The Book Service will update its book information with the new review count.

**Project Structure:**

**Instructions:**

1. Set up RabbitMQ: Make sure you have RabbitMQ installed and running on your local machine or in a container. You can use Docker to run RabbitMQ with a predefined configuration.

2. Implement the Book Service: Create the Book Service microservice. This service should expose an API to retrieve book details and maintain a database of books.

3. Implement the Review Service: Create the Review Service microservice. This service should expose APIs to submit and retrieve book reviews. When a review is submitted, it should publish a message to RabbitMQ with details about the book and the review.

4. Configure RabbitMQ: Configure RabbitMQ in both microservices to establish communication between them. Set up a RabbitMQ exchange and queues for message publishing and subscribing.

5. Handle Messages: In the Book Service, create a message listener that consumes messages from RabbitMQ and updates the book information with the new review count.

6. Test the Microservices: Test the microservices by sending review submissions through the Review Service API. Observe how the Book Service updates book information based on the reviews received via RabbitMQ.

7. Docker Compose: Optionally, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run RabbitMQ, the Book Service, and the Review Service in Docker containers for easier setup and testing.

This project will provide you with a hands-on experience of using RabbitMQ for communication between microservices in a simple, real-world scenario involving books and reviews. You can extend the project by adding features like user authentication, error handling, and additional book-related functionalities.
