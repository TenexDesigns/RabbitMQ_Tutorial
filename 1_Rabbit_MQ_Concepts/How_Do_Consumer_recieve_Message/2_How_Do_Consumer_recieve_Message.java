Consumers in RabbitMQ subscribe to queues. Once a consumer is subscribed to a queue, it will receive all of the messages that are published to the queue. The relationship between consumers and queues is one where the consumers listen to the messages in the queue.

When a producer publishes a message to a queue, RabbitMQ will deliver the message to the first available consumer that is subscribed to the queue. If there are no available consumers, the message will remain in the queue until a consumer becomes available.

Consumers can acknowledge messages to let RabbitMQ know that they have successfully processed the message. Once a message is acknowledged, RabbitMQ will delete the message from the queue.

Consumers can also reject messages. If a consumer rejects a message, RabbitMQ will redeliver the message to another consumer. This process continues until the message is successfully processed or it expires.

Here is an example of how consumers consume messages in RabbitMQ:

```python
import pika

# Connect to the broker
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))

# Create a channel
channel = connection.channel()

# Declare a queue
channel.queue_declare(queue='my-queue')

# Define a callback function to handle incoming messages
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(f"Received message: {body}")
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)

# Start consuming messages
channel.basic_consume(queue='my-queue', on_message_callback=callback)

# Wait for messages
channel.start_consuming()
```

In this example, the consumer subscribes to the `my-queue` queue. When a message is published to the `my-queue` queue, the consumer's callback function will be called with the message body. The callback function can then process the message and acknowledge it.

Consumers can also use the `basic_qos()` method to control how many messages they receive at a time. This can be useful for consumers that need to process messages slowly or consumers that need to avoid overloading themselves.

The relationship between consumers and queues in RabbitMQ is a powerful one that allows you to build scalable and reliable messaging systems.
