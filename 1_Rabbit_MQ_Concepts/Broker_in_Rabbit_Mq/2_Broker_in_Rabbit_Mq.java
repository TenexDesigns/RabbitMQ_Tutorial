A broker in RabbitMQ is a server that runs the RabbitMQ software. It is responsible for routing messages between producers and consumers.

The statement "to connect to the RabbitMQ broker using AMQP" means to connect to the RabbitMQ server using the AMQP protocol. AMQP is the messaging protocol that RabbitMQ uses to communicate with clients.

In order to use RabbitMQ, you need to have a RabbitMQ broker running. You can then connect to the broker using a RabbitMQ client library for your programming language. Once you are connected to the broker, you can start sending and receiving messages.

Here are some examples of how to connect to the RabbitMQ broker using AMQP:

```python
import pika

# Connect to the broker
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))

# Create a channel
channel = connection.channel()

# Declare a queue
channel.queue_declare(queue='my-queue')

# Publish a message to the queue
channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='my-queue', body='Hello, world!')

# Close the channel and connection
channel.close()
connection.close()
```

```java
import com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory;
import com.rabbitmq.client.Connection;
import com.rabbitmq.client.Channel;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Connect to the broker
        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
        factory.setHost("localhost");
        Connection connection = factory.newConnection();

        // Create a channel
        Channel channel = connection.createChannel();

        // Declare a queue
        channel.queueDeclare("my-queue", false, false, false, null);

        // Publish a message to the queue
        channel.basicPublish("", "my-queue", null, "Hello, world!".getBytes());

        // Close the channel and connection
        channel.close();
        connection.close();
    }
}
```

Once you are connected to the broker, you can start sending and receiving messages. You can use exchanges and queues to route messages to different consumers. You can also use features like message delivery guarantees and routing to build complex and reliable messaging systems.
