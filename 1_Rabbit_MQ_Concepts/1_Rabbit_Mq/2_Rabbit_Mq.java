**RabbitMQ technical terms:**

* **Producer:** An application that sends messages to RabbitMQ.
* **Consumer:** An application that receives messages from RabbitMQ.
* **Queue:** A buffer that stores messages until they are consumed.
* **Exchange:** A router that determines where messages are sent.
* **Binding:** A configuration that tells RabbitMQ how exchanges and queues are connected.
* **Message:** A unit of information that is sent from a producer to a consumer.

**What is needed to use RabbitMQ:**

* A RabbitMQ broker. This is a server that runs the RabbitMQ software.
* A RabbitMQ client library for your programming language. This is a library that allows your application to send and receive messages from RabbitMQ.
* A basic understanding of the AMQP messaging protocol. AMQP is the protocol that RabbitMQ uses to communicate with clients.

**Is the Java Messaging Service (JMS) needed to use RabbitMQ?**

No, JMS is not needed to use RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ supports a variety of messaging protocols, including AMQP, STOMP, and MQTT. You can use any RabbitMQ client library to connect to RabbitMQ, regardless of whether or not it supports JMS.

However, if you are using a Java application, you may want to consider using a JMS client library. JMS is a standard Java API for messaging, and it provides a number of features that can be useful for developing messaging applications.

**Here are some examples of JMS client libraries for Java:**

* ActiveMQ Artemis
* Apache Qpid JMS
* IBM WebSphere MQ JMS Client

If you are unsure whether or not to use JMS, I recommend that you start by learning about the AMQP protocol. AMQP is the simplest way to connect to RabbitMQ, and it is supported by a wide range of client libraries. Once you have a good understanding of AMQP, you can decide whether or not to use JMS based on your specific needs.
